Hey friends,

I recently listened to [Simon Sinek’s interview on Diary of a CEO](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkurnp5307t5hddo032h3/owhkhqh4dkqp5miq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1RLXp1VFp1WWVDZw==), and it made me rethink how I set goals.

There seems to be a distinction between *Selfish Goals* and *Service Goals:*

**Selfish Goals** are things you want to achieve for your own benefit. Like becoming a millionaire (to have a nice lifestyle), or getting six-pack abs (to feel more attractive).

**Service Goals** are things you want to achieve to help other people, like setting up an anti-malaria charity, or making enough money to provide for your kids.

The problem is, selfish goals don’t satisfy us in the long run (Btw, when I say ‘selfish’ I don’t mean in the nasty way, I just mean ‘benefitting myself primarily’, no moral judgment attached to that).

Super-successful athletes seem to dedicate their whole lives to *selfish goals* (like winning Wimbledon or getting multiple Olympic gold medals). But once they’ve actually achieved those goals they often get depressed.

They realise that:

1. They’ve lost their sense of purpose. They’ve achieved their finite, selfish goal – what now?
2. They don’t have many deep relationships, because their whole life was engineered to achieve that selfish goal. The relationships they *have* built (coaches, friends, maybe family) are focused on getting *them* what *they* want.
3. They also realise that, while chasing selfish goals is pretty adrenaline-inducing, actually achieving them isn’t that satisfying because no-one really shares in your success.

That last point is really important. We’re social creatures that get real, lasting satisfaction from actually helping and being valuable to other people, not just winning a bunch of medals for ourselves.

Also, the writer [Mo Gowdat](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gkurnp5307t5hddo032h3/x0hph6hn0rqox4sg/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS96OFAtdkVWQ2pMaz90PTIzMA==) makes the point that service goals can be energising **even if you don’t succeed**. Like, his big goal in life is to make 1 billion people happier. Now usually, my inner Stoic would say - huh, that sounds like a goal I can’t control, something to avoid. But because it’s a *service goal,* Mo says it feels motivating, not demoralising, to set his aims high.

So how has this changed my goal-setting?

Well, over the last few years, I’ve essentially set myself *Selfish Goals*. Making money, becoming a NY Times bestselling author, growing my audience. My business has always been about, in this order:

1. Making money
2. Helping me live a fun life
3. Helping other people.

But now I’m making a conscious effort to reverse that order, because helping other people through making amazing content might - weirdly enough - be the best way for me to live a fulfilling life.

Have a great week!
